Subject: DataShare: Registration Notification

Dear {0}

Thank you for registering with Edinburgh DataShare, an open access digital repository of multi-disciplinary research datasets produced at the University of Edinburgh, and hosted by Library and University Collections.

DataShare is free at the point of use, and there are a number of benefits to depositing your research data in this institutional data repository (see http://edin.ac/1fsIdg4).

The repository is organised firstly into Communities and sub-communities (e.g. by College, School and organisational unit) and then into Collections containing related datasets (for example, by research theme or research group). All new DataShare items (i.e. datasets) must be deposited into a Collection, and when submitting a new DataShare item you should identify which Collection is most suitable for your item.

You may start a new submission by visiting the DataShare home page (https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/) and clicking on the "Deposit data" button to begin your submission. Items submitted from the home page will initially be placed in the 'Default holding collection' and will need to be moved to the appropriate collection by the Research Data Support team, once you have provided the details.

More information about the submission process is available on the 'How to deposit page' (http://edin.ac/1fsMIaj) where you can find links to the 'Checklist for deposit' guidance on preparing to share your data and the 'DataShare User Guide' detailing the metadata you will need to provide.

Please contact us (data-support@ed.ac.uk) if you have questions not covered here, or would like to speak with a member of the team to discuss your requirements.

We look forward to receiving your data.

Regards,

Research Data Support team
